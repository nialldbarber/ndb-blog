summary: What is a proxy?
---

A proxy is basically a middleman. It stands in the middle of two things and processes that information, passing it to the other, back and forth etc. Think about it in terms of two people having an argument. They're arguing with one another but are not directly speaking to each other; they're passing their points onto a middleman, who relays the information to the other party.
