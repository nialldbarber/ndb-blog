summary: Creating Immutable structures with TypeScript!

## Problem?

If we want to make sure our variables are immutable, we generally reach for `const` to make sure it's value can't be changed. This works great for primitive types such as strings, numbers etc, but not for non-primitive types like arrays and objects.

For instance, this code will result in an error:

```js
const milesToWalk = 500

milesToWalk = 1_000_000

// => ❌ Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

We'd also get an error if we tried to change the value of an object:

```js
const milesToWalk = {
  whoWouldWalkIt: 'i!',
}

milesToWalk = 'not me!'

// => ❌ Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

But! we can change a value within an object:

```js
const milesToWalk = {
  whoWouldWalkIt: 'i!',
}

milesToWalk.whoWouldWalkIt = 'not me!'

console.log(milesToWalk) // => ✅ {whoWouldWalkIt: 'not me!'}
```

## Solution

With TypeScript, we can make our non-primitive types immutable by using a _`const` assertion_. It's essentially a way to turn our data in types and to make them immutable:

```ts
const milesToWalk = {
  whoWouldWalkIt: 'i!',
} as const

milesToWalk.whoWouldWalkIt = 'not me!'

// ==> ❌ Cannot assign to 'whoWouldWalkIt'
//        because it is a read-only property.
```

You can also achieve this with the `readonly` keyword with TypeScript:

```ts
type MilesToWalk = {
  readonly whoWouldWalkIt: string
}

const milesToWalk: MilesToWalk = {
  whoWouldWalkIt: 'i!',
}

milesToWalk.whoWouldWalkIt = 'not me!'

// ==> ❌ Cannot assign to 'whoWouldWalkIt'
//        because it is a read-only property.
```

## Useful?

Why is this useful? Well there are times when building your application, you may need to create values that must _never_ change. Usually, we just create an object and hope no one updates it. For instance, let's say we're creating a design system and need to make a list of sizes:

```jsx
const fontSizes = {
  xsm: '12px',
  sm: '14px',
  md: '16px',
  lg: '18px',
  xl: '20px',
}
```

Ideally, we don't want this data to change unless we come in and change it ourselves. But what if someone accidentally changes a value?:

```jsx
import { fontSizes } from '~/app/styles/system'

function imBeingABitCareless() {
  let { sm, md, lg } = fontSizes
  // for whatever reason you do:
  lg = '50px'
  // ... etc
}
```

Not ideal. Let's just make our design system immutable with TypeScript!:

```ts
const fontSizes = {
  xxsm: '12px',
  sm: '14px',
  md: '16px',
  lg: '18px',
  xxl: '20px',
} as const

let { sm, md, lg } = fontSizes
lg = '50px'

// => ❌ Type '"50px"' is not assignable to type '"18px"'.
```
